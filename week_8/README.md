## Foundational models of ecological systems (10:00 - 15:00)

#### Topic 1: Exponential growth - Ecological justification and implementation 
      
#### Topic 2: Logistic growth - Background, intuition, and computer exercises  
      -Exercise 1: Implementing the logistic map
      -Exercise 2: Qualitative model behavior with lambda  
      -Exercise 3: Long term behavior and sensitivity on initial conditions

#### Topic 3: Other forms of population regulation - the predator-prey model
      - Exercise 1: Deriving predator-prey model from exponential growth equation
      - Exercise 2: Implementing predator-prey model
      - Exercise 3: Qualitative behavior and the addition of density dependce on the prey population
      
#### Topic 4: Spatial considerations in ecological models
