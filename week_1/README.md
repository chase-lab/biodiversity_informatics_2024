## Week 1: (Monday, April 17): What is Biodiversity and how do you measure it?
Jon and Alban

### Morning session

Part I. Introduction to Course (including discussion of weekend tree survey) and Lecture

Part II. Lab
  
1.	Each student will sample ALL organisms from each of 3 local sites (bags) in a metacommunity (samples will be given at the start of the exercise). Names of species given in ppt.
2.	Open up the Google Spreadsheet--https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SGtdU61_3vX43Xtjaq579nEF1xuelRY3Dol2WGKFzUk/edit?usp=sharing
3.	Enter data for each 'control' sample in the appropriate place
4.	Calculate species richness for each local community (bag)
5.	Calculate species richness for each metacommunity (3 bags for each person)
6.	Calculate species richness for the entire region (sum of all 4 metacommunities [12 bags total])
7.	Draw species accumulation curve at 3 different spatial scales (1 local sample-->3 samples in a metacommunity-->entire region [all 4 metacommunities])
8.	Explore other summary variables (i.e., relative abundances, evenness, diversity) at each spatial scale
9.	Experimentally impose 'predation' of 50% of individuals by an introduced predator (e.g., raccoons invading Europe). IMPORTANT: Experimental predation must be random
10.	Repeat Step #3-7 but with 'impact' data (after predation)
11.	Compare species accumulation curves (from step #7) across scales
12.	Calculate log ratio effect sizes of species richness loss for each scale (local, metacommunity, region)










### Afternoon session

In the afternoon session, we'll introduce R, git, GitHub and basic reproducibility good practices.
